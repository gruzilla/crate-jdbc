Compatibility
=============

.. NOTE::

   The 2.x.x releases of this library differ from the 1.x.x releases in two
   ways.

   The `connection string`_ changed to the same format as PostgreSQL JDBC,
   which means that setting the default schema with the connection string is
   not supported. Use ``setSchema()`` instead or provide a schema name in a
   SQL statement.

   Additionally, support for the experimental ``showsubcolumns`` parameter has
   been dropped.

JDBC
====

This JDBC driver follows the JDBC 4.1 standard, however the following features
are not supported:

* ``java.sql.ParameterMetaData`` as returned by e.g. ``java.sql.PreparedStatement``
* ``DataSource``
* ``CallableStatement`` as CrateDB does not support stored procedures

For further details about compatibility with all possible JDBC features,
see the `ResultSet`_, `ResultSetMetaData`_ and `DatabaseMetaData`_
implementations.

**Though only an optional feature, it is still worth mentioning:**

* the ``ResultSet`` is read only (``TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY``, ``CONCUR_READ_ONLY``),
  so changes to a ``ResultSet`` are not supported. Though DDL and DML statements
  are supported using the ``Statement`` and ``PreparedStatement`` interfaces.

CrateDB
=======

For driver versions 1.x:

- CrateDB 0.38.x or later, but older than 0.56.0

For driver versions 2.x:

- CrateDB 0.56.x or later

All versions of the JDBC driver >= 2.0.x require CrateDB 0.56.0 or newer.
Previous versions of the JDBC driver (1.x) are only compatible with older
versions of CrateDB.

The support for versions of the JDBC driver >= 2.0.x with CrateDB version
0.56.x is **experimental**. The binding between versions of the JDBC
driver >= 2.0.x and CrateDB are stable for CrateDB versions 0.57.x and higher.

Below, you can see the compatibility table for the JDBC driver:

| CrateDB JDBC driver | CrateDB Version | Notes                                         |
+=====================+=================+===============================================+
| ``1.x``             | ``<= 0.55.x``   | Uses transport protocol, default port 4300.   |
+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| ``2.x``             | ``0.56.x``      | The **psql.enabled** must be set to **true**. |
